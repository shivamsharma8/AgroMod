        <p>The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is a crop insurance scheme launched by the Government of India on February 18, 2016, aimed at providing financial support to farmers in the event of crop failure due to natural calamities, pests, and diseases. This initiative is part of the government's efforts to promote sustainable agriculture and protect farmers from financial distress.</p>
        <p>Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (PMFBY) aims to provide a comprehensive insurance cover against failure of the crop thus helping in stabilising the income of the farmers. The scheme covers all Food & Oilseeds crops and Annual Commercial/Horticultural Crops for which past yield data is available and for which requisite number of crop cutting experiments are being conducted under General Crop Estimation Survey. The scheme is implemented by empanelled general insurance companies. Selection of Implementing Agency is done by the concerned State Government through bidding. The scheme was earlier compulsory for loanee farmers availing crop loan /KCC account for notified crops and voluntary for other others, but has been made voluntary since 2020 when reforms in the scheme were introduced.[2] The scheme is being administered by Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.</p>
