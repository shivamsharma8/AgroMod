        The scheme was first conceived and implemented by government of
        Telangana as the Rythu Bandhu scheme, where a certain amount is given
        directly to eligible farmers. The scheme has received accolades from
        various organisations for its successful implementation, including World
        Bank. Many economist suggest that this type of investment support is
        better than farm loan waivers. With the positive outcome of this scheme,
        Government of India wanted to implement it as nationwide project and it
        was announced by Piyush Goyal during the 2019 Interim Union Budget of
        India on 1 February 2019.
