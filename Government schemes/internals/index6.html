        <p>The "Formation & Promotion of 10,000 Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs)" scheme is a Central Sector Scheme launched by the Government of India to enhance the collective strength of farmers. The scheme aims to form and promote 10,000 new FPOs over five years, from 2020-21 to 2024-25, with the goal of improving the income levels and livelihood security of small and marginal farmers. FPOs are voluntary organizations formed by primary producers, where members are farmers, milk producers, fishermen, weavers, rural artisans, and craftsmen.</p>
        <p>The FPOs are based on the concept of "Cluster-Based Business Organizations" and are intended to be run by farmers and entrepreneurs themselves, ensuring they cater specifically to the needs of their members. The FPOs will provide better bargaining power, access to inputs, technology, credit, and market linkages to their members.</p>
