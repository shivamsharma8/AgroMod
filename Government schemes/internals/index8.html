        <p>The Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) and Price Support Scheme (PSS) are governmental initiatives designed to stabilize prices and support farmers in times of market distress. These schemes are aimed at providing price stability and preventing price crashes in agricultural commodities, thereby ensuring fair returns for farmers and protecting their income.</p>
        <p>The MIS focuses on intervening in the market to support the prices of specific commodities when they fall below a predetermined level. The PSS provides price support to farmers by purchasing crops at a minimum support price (MSP) when market prices fall below the MSP.</p>
