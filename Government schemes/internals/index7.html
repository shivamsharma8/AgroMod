        <p>The "National Beekeeping and Honey Mission (NBHM)" is a Central Sector Scheme launched by the Government of India under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat initiative. The mission aims to promote holistic growth of the beekeeping industry, thereby increasing farmer income, generating rural employment, and ensuring nutritional and ecological security. The mission focuses on promoting scientific beekeeping practices to enhance the production and quality of honey and other beehive products.</p>
        <p>The NBHM is being implemented through the National Bee Board (NBB) under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. The scheme promotes beekeeping as an enterprise for small and marginal farmers, tribal communities, and unemployed youth, especially in rural areas, to diversify their income sources and support sustainable agricultural practices.</p>
